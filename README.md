# PropertyAttributeHelper

This is a small solution for obtaining custom attributes information. You can get all the attribues from a specfic property or you can obtain information of a specific type of attribute.

If you want to take a look of how to use this library please use as reference the test library.

I created a nuget package if you want to use it in your .net Core projects. Let me know if you want new features or need something else, I'll be pleased to help you out.
